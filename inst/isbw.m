## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} isbw (@var{img}, @var{logic})
## Return true if @var{img} is a black and white image.
##
## A variable can be considered a black and white image if it is a
## non-sparse matrix of size @nospell{MxNx1xK}, and depending on the
## string @var{logic}, defined as:
##
## @table @asis
## @item @qcode{"logical"} (default)
## @var{img} must be of class logical.
##
## @item @qcode{"non-logical"}
## all values in @var{img} are either 1 or 0.
## @end table
##
## @strong{Note:} despite their suggestive names, the functions isbw,
## isgray, isind, and isrgb, are ambiguous since it is not always possible
## to distinguish between those image types.  For example, an uint8 matrix
## can be both a grayscale and indexed image.  They are good to dismiss
## input as an invalid image type, but not for identification.

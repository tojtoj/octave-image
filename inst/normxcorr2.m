## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} normxcorr2 (@var{template}, @var{img})
## Compute the normalized 2D cross-correlation.
##
## Returns the normalized cross correlation matrix of @var{template} and
## @var{img} so that a value of 1 corresponds to the positions of @var{img} that
## match @var{template} perfectly.
##
## @emph{Note}: this function exists only for @sc{matlab} compatibility and is
## just a wrapper to the @code{coeff} option of @code{xcorr2} with the arguments
## inverted.  See the @code{xcorr2} documentation for more details. Same results
## can be obtained with @code{xcorr2 (img, template, "coeff")}

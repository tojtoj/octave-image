  ## a = logical([1 0 1 1]); b = logical([1 0 0 0]); c = imadd (a, b);

  ##    (1) is c(1) == 2 on the first example? Then addition is done img + val.
  ##    (2) output class. If it is logical on the second example
  ## also the following
  ## a = uint16(round(rand(5)*300)); b = uint16(round(rand(5)*300)); c = imadd (a, b, "uint8")

  ## of the input image? Is the requested for the class also honored?

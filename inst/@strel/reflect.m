## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{se2} =} reflect (@var{se})
## Reflect structuring element of strel object.
##
## Returns another strel object with all its elements reflected.  If @var{se} is
## a sequence of strel objects, reflects each one of them.  If @var{se} is a
## non-flat structuring element, its height is reflected accordingly.
##
## Reflection is a rotation of 180 degrees around the center, including for
## N-dimensional matrices.

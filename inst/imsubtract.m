## @deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{out} =} imsubtract (@var{a}, @var{b}, @var{class})
## Subtract image or constant to an image.
##
## If @var{a} and @var{b} are two images of same size and class, @var{b} is subtracted
## to @var{a}. Alternatively, if @var{b} is a floating-point scalar, its value is subtracted
## to the image @var{a}.
##
## The class of @var{out} will be the same as @var{a} unless @var{a} is logical
## in which case @var{out} will be double. Alternatively, the class can be
## specified with @var{class}.
##
## @emph{Note 1}: you can force output class to be logical by specifying
## @var{class}. This is incompatible with @sc{matlab} which will @emph{not} honour
## request to return a logical matrix.
##
## @emph{Note 2}: the values are truncated to the mininum value of the output
## class.

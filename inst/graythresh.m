## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{level}=} graythresh (@var{I})
## Compute global image threshold using Otsu's method.
##
## The output @var{level} is a global threshold (level) that can be used to convert
## an intensity image to a binary image with @code{im2bw}.
## @var{level} is a normalized intensity value that lies in the range [0, 1]. 
## 
## The function uses Otsu's method, which chooses the threshold to
## minimize the intraclass variance of the black and white pixels. 
## 
## Color images are converted grayscale before @var{level} is computed.

## I added texinfo documentation, error checking and sanitised the code.

This directory contains functions that have been used to develop some of
the image processing functions in the parent directory. This files are
not needed at runtime for them to work, so they are not installed.

They are helpul, though, to know how functions have been developped
and for debugging.

The function deriche has been removed from the package due to its non-standard
license. Its original author and copyright owner does not reply to e-mails
christian.kotz@gmx.net or facebook messages http://www.facebook.com/KoraxKorakos

The deriche function would ideally be implemented again as an edge option,
possible as part of the canny option since they are very similar.

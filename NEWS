 Summary of important user-visible changes for image 2.2.2 (2014/10/06):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Multiple documentation fixes for compatibility with new versions of
    Texinfo.

 ** Fix error with imcrop when image was all zeros.

 ** Fix endless loop in bwdist when using the quasi-euclidean method in
    x86 systems.


 Summary of important user-visible changes for image 2.2.1 (2014/03/08):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** imcrop had many alternative interfaces added for more flexibility.
    Added support in the input for indexed images, figures handles,
    N-dimensional images, and specific bounding box vector for a
    non-interactive usage.  Output can now also return the bounding box used
    for the cropping in addition to the cropped image.  It will no longer
    loop forever until it gets two valid coordinates for the bounding box.

 ** Fixed bug in imcomplement to compute the complement of signed integers
    correctly.

 ** Fix imrotate to handle RGB images.

 ** Fix regression in bwdist when calculating the closest pixel map.


 Summary of important user-visible changes for image 2.2.0 (2014/01/08):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The imerode and imdilate have been completely rewritten for increased
    performance and many Matlab compatibility fixes. Performance gains between
    1.5-30X have been demonstrated. Main compatibility changes include the
    addition of the shape option, support for the strel class, and allowing
    structuring elements and images of different classes. Non-flat grayscale
    erosion and dilation has also been implemented by making use of the new
    strel class.

 ** With the increased performance in imerode and imdilate, all other
    functions that use them, such imopen and imclose, get an equivalent
    performance boost.

 ** Most of bwmorph operations now support N dimensional images and have
    increased performance.  Other Matlab compatibility fixes have been
    made such as displaying image when there's no output variable.

 ** The __spatial_filtering__ function has been mostly rewritten and
    performs in approximattely 1/5 to 2/5 of the previous time, depending
    on the filter.  With this change, all functions dependent on it,
    rangefilt, entropyfilt, ordfilt2/n, medfilt2/n, and stdfilt, will also
    perform faster.

 ** The following functions are new:

      bwareaopen            impixel               strel
      checkerboard          imtransform           tformfwd
      cp2tform              intlut                tforminv
      findbounds            labelmatrix           ycbcr2rgb
      imgradient            maketform
      imgradientxy          montage

 ** The following functions have been moved from the Octave Forge Image package
    to GNU Octave core:

      cmpermute       cmunique        iscolormap      rgbplot

 ** The following functions have been deprecated in the previous release
    of the Image package and have now been removed:

      blkproc         bmpwrite        dilate          erode

 ** The following functions have been deprecated (see their help text
    for the recommended alternatives):

      bwborder              imrotate_Fourier      iptcheckstrs
      impad                 iptchecknargin        uintlut

 ** The functions im2col and col2im has been completely rewritten for massive
    performace increase (increases greater than 500X have been observed, with
    biggest differences for smaller blocks and sliding option), and support of
    N-dimensional blocks and images.

 ** rgb2ycbcr was completely rewritten to accept images of other classes, and
    colormaps.  A new argument was implemented to convert the RGB values
    according to different standards.

 ** The use of non logical matrices to specify the neighborhood for the medfilt2
    function has been deprecated.  Also, when using a vector to specify the size
    of the neighborhood, the elements were swapped (first element is now the
    number of rows and the second the number of columns).

 ** For consistency with other functions that allow specification of padding
    values, the function padarray now accepts the string "zeros" as a valid
    option.

 ** The plot produced by imhist is correctly scaled on the X axis so that the
    colorbar corresponds to the actual intensity of the stems; the given
    colormarp is used on the colorbar for indexed images; and the stems no
    longer display the markers at their top. The Y axis is also adjusted in case
    of peaks with high values that prevent a good overview of the histogram.

 ** The option to create poisson noise to an image has been added to imnoise.

 ** With the addition of the strel class, imdilate and imerode are able
    to handle strel objects.

 ** The performance of imresize has been greatly improved when using the
    nearest neighbor method for N or 1/N scale factors (e.g.: 2, 50, 1/4, 1/7).

 ** The imperspectivewarp, imremap, imresize, and imrotate functions will now
    accept any interpolation method from the interp2 function thus extending
    the available methods to "spline" and "pchip".  This in addition to the
    "bilinear" and "bicubic" methods (same as "linear" and "cubic" respectively)
    which are kept for matlab compatibility.  For the same reason, the
    "triangle" method (interpolation kernel) has also been added (which is the
    same as "linear" method).

 ** Bug fixes on the concavity, intermodes, maxlikelihood, and minimum methods
    of graythresh.

 ** The bwdist function will now consider any non zero value as object pixels,
    the class of the distance matrix has changed to single, and indexes an
    uint dependent on the matrix size.

 ** The transform option of imtophat has been removed (it was deprecated
    in version 2.0.0) in favour of using imbothat.

 ** The function bwconncomp now returns the indices for each element in each
    object, no longer the indices for the elements in the object boundaries
    only. The connectivity default was changed to 8.

 ** The original Shepp-Logan model in the function phantom as been changed to
    return all values in the range [0 1] rather than [0 2] by changing the
    intensity of the first ellipse from 2 to 1.

 ** Other functions that have been changed for smaller bugfixes, increased
    Matlab compatibility, or performance:

      bwlabel               bwperim               padarray

 ** The following functions now fully support matrices with an arbitrary
    number of dimensions:

      bestblk               col2im                im2col
      bwconncomp            colfilt               nlfilter


 Summary of important user-visible changes for image 2.0.0 (2012/11/08):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new:

      analyze75info         imabsdiff         iptcheckconn
      analyze75read         imadd             iptcheckmap
      analyze75write        imbothat          iptchecknargin
      blockproc             imcrop            iptcheckstrs
      bwlabeln              imdivide          iptnum2ordinal
      getrangefromclass     imlincomb         iscolormap
      im2int16              immultiply        normxcorr2
      im2single             imsubtract        wavelength2rgb

 ** The following functions have been deprecated in previous releases
    of the image package and have now been removed:

      imginfo

 ** The function `deriche' has been removed.

 ** The complete set of functions to work with Analyze 7.5 files has been
    implemented. See `analyze75info', `analyze75read' and `analyze75write'.

 ** `graythresh' can optionally accept an histogram rather than an image.  This
    allows for preprocessing of the histogram previous to an automatic threshold
    selection.

 ** Otsu's method for automatic threshold selection (default for `graythresh')
    has been completely rewritten and should perform faster. Now, it can also
    return a second value representing the ``goodness'' of the computed
    threshold value (within class variance).

 ** Alternative algorithms for automatic threshold have been implemented in
    `graythresh' (thanks to Antti Niemist√∂ for releasing HistThresh toolbox 
    http://www.cs.tut.fi/~ant/histthresh/ from where many were ported, under a
    GPL license). Currently, the following algorithms have been implemented
    (see graythresh for notes and references):

      concavity       MaxEntropy        minimum       Otsu
      intermeans      MaxLikelihood     MinError      percentile
      intermodes      mean              moments

 ** The following functions have been deprecated (see their help text
    for the recommended alternatives):

      blkproc         bmpwrite          dilate        erode

 ** With the new function `imbothat' the transform option of
    `imtophat' has been deprecated.

 ** The following functions have had been changed for bug fixes and/or
    improved matlab compatibility

      bwarea          imhist            im2uint8      isind
      bweuler         imnoise           im2uint16     mat2gray
      bwfill          conndef           isbw          rgb2gray
      cmpermute       im2bw             isgray
      cmunique        im2double         isrgb

 ** `bwarea' now supports all image classes and considers objects all non
    zero pixels (not all pixels higher than zero).

 ** `rgb2gray' now also supports images of the class single and performs a
    weighted conversion to keep the image luminance instead of a the mean
    through each color.

 ** `im2bw' now supports input images of the int16 class and deals better with
    RGB images since it uses `rgb2gray' internally (see changes to rgb2gray).
    Threshold is performed on all values greater than value instead of greater
    than or equal.

 ** `imhist' is much more compatible with matlab and among other changes,
    it now uses the whole range of the class for the histogram rather than
    the minimum and maximum of the input image and displays a colorbar under
    the histogram.

 ** `isbw' now defines a black-and-white image as a binary non-sparse
    matrix. This is compatible with matlab. To use the old behaviour,
    use the new option for the call "isbw (img, "non-logical").
    For backwards compatibility, if a non-logical matrix of 0 and 1 is
    used as input, `isbw' will still return true but a warning will be
    issued since this will deprecated later.

 ** `isgray' now also returns true for matrices of the int16 class.

 ** `isrgb' now returns false for logical matrix.

 ** `tiff_tag_read' had several bug fixes and can now check IFDs beyond
    the first. It can also accept mutiple tag values and IFDs simultaneously
    and return a matrix of the values found. Its documentation has been
    expanded (as well as an explanation of TIFF structure on the source)

 ** For sake of matlab compatibility, the behaviour of `mat2gray' has been
    greatly changed. Among the changes, it will no longer swap the minimum and
    maximum options if the first is larger than the later. Instead, will return
    the image complement after truncation. Also, when the maximum and minimum
    values are equal, `mat2gray' will truncate all values between 0 and 1. See
    the help text (or source) for a detailed description of cautions.

 ** `bwfill' was fixed to always returns a logical matrix.

 ** `imnoise' has been expanded to accept images of differente classes instead
    of only double and single.

 ** The private function `__bwdist` has been renamed `__bwdist__`

 ** Package is now dependent on GNU Octave version 3.6.0 or later.

 ** Package is now dependent on the signal package version 1.2.0 or later.

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.

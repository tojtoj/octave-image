Summary of important user-visible changes for image 1.1.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new:

      blockproc
      bwlabeln
      getrangefromclass
      imadd
      imbothat
      imsubtract
      iptcheckconn
      iptcheckmap
      iptchecknargin
      iptcheckstrs
      iptnum2ordinal

 ** The following functions have been deprecated in previous releases
    of the image package and have now been removed:

      imginfo

 ** The following functions have been deprecated (see their help text
    for the recommended alternatives):

      blkproc
      dilate
      erode

 ** With the new function `imbothat' the transform option of
    `imtophat' has been deprecated.

 ** The following functions have had been changed for bug fixes and/or
    improved matlab compatibility

      bweuler
      imhist
      conndef
      isbw
      isgray
      isrgb
      isind

 ** `isbw' now defines a black-and-white image as a binary non-sparse
    matrix. This is compatible with matlab. To use the old behaviour,
    use the new option for the call "isbw (img, "non-logical").
    For backwards compatibility, if a non-logical matrix of 0 and 1 is
    used as input, `isbw' will still return true but a warning will be
    issued since this will deprecated later.

 ** `isrgb' now returns false for logical matrix.

/*
 * This is a sweep-and-update Euclidean distance transform of
 * a binary image. All positive pixels are considered object
 * pixels, zero or negative pixels are treated as background.
 *
 * By Stefan Gustavson (stefan.gustavson@gmail.com).
 *
 * Originally written in 1994, based on paper-only descriptions
 * of the SSED8 algorithm, invented by Per-Erik Danielsson
 * and improved by Ingemar Ragnemalm. This is a classic algorithm
 * with roots in the 1980s, still very good for the 2D case.
 *
 * Updated in 2004 to treat pixels at image edges correctly,
 * and to improve code readability.
 *
 * Edited in 2009 to form the foundation for Octave BWDIST:
 * added #define-configurable distance measure and function name
 *

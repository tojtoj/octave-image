// Core is going through a bunch of changes, and moving a lot of
// functions into the octave namespace and deprecating thw old
// functions.  We want to be compatible with older versions and we
// don't want to scare users with deprecation warnings so we have our
// own wrappers so nothing breaks.
//
// We don't want to have a file per function we need to wrap; we don't
// want to repeat the wrapper in each file that needs it; we don't
// want to disable the deprecation warnings (so that we get warnings
// next time we something else gets deprecated); and we don't want to
// include all needed headers.
//
// It is the job of the file that includes this to include the
// required headers, at least as long as core only changes the
// namespace and not the header file.
//
// This wrappers are all temporary until we no longer support the
// Octave version that made the change.
